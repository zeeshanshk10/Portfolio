            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Music uplifts your state of mind. There is right kind of music for every mood of ours. The variety of Music which we are offered to us is kind of exciting and overwhelming at the same time. It is important that we, as users, get the right Music player app which understands our taste and suggests the right kind of music from the vast ocean of songs, genres, artists and more.

            <!--container for Challenges-->
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>There were 3 key goals that I had to accomplish for this project:</p>
            <p> 1. To design a UI which is creative but also familiar to the users.
                <br>
                2. The interface should be easy to use and navigate and therefore it should be intuitive and consistent.
                <br>
                3. To create a UI which is attractive and at the same time comfortable to interact with.

            <!-- container for Style Guide header, images, and text -->
            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to go with the dark theme for the UI because, as per user research music apps are used by the majority of tenegers during night time.  Dark mode is sleek, cool, and elegant, which could be why nearly 85% of people prefer to use it, so for the color palette, I opted for dark shades with btight color gradients. </p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I adopted one of the primary methods for conducting the user research- user surveys, with a survey size of 100. The motive behind selecting research method was to get a quantitative data to identify the user tastes, behavior and preferences. The survey form which I prepared covered a range of questions. Some of the relevant questions are listed below:</p>
            <br>
            <p> 1. Which apps do you use to listen to music?</p>
            <p> 2. Do you like to explore new music or are you happy listening to your regular playlist?</p>
            <p> 3. How do you discover new music?</p>
            <p> 4. Do you listen to suggested songs from a particular music app?</p>
            <p> 5. Do you create your own playlist?</p>
            <p> 6. How often do you share music with others?</p>
            <p> 7. Do you prefer the Dark or Light theme in our music player app?</p>
            <br>
            <p> The results of the surveys were as follows:</p>

            <!-- Container for emphathizing with users header and text)-->
            <h2>User Persona</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Based on the data collected from the surveys, I created a User persona to collate and highlight the user expectations, needs and frustrations. To save my time, I used the available template on Figma Community.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="case-container">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>After empathizing with users, I created the wireframes. I always keep my initial wireframes simple, in order to be able to quickly test them with users early in the process. Next, I digitalized my wireframes in
            Figma. </p>
            <br>

        </div>
        <div class="case-container">
            <h2>User Testing</h2>
            <p>Using my professional network, I recruited 5 participants to accomplish a task scenario. I wanted to ensure that the flow and layout of my wireframes were intuitive and simple before moving on to finalizing my design. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Changes in Design after User Testing</h3>
            <p>Taking into considerations all of the above faults in my old design, I recreated the new design with the necessary changes, added new features, animations, micro interactions and made it more desirable and efficient to use.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>User Feedback:</h3>
            <p>A couple of pain points that I encountered were that the application requires good internet connectivity to feth the songs; the quality of songs also gets affected due to poor connectivity. I ensured that these issues were all fixed right away for my next iteration. </p>

            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>I love to step out of my comfort zone and continue to evolve. I just focused on the design part, I didn't have any proper documentation to justify my solution, but you can clearly see my evolution in the design. I believe “The best design a designer can make in a given time determines his skills and how good he is.” </p>
