            <!--container for Overview-->
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>There have increase in number of accidents in recent times , we also see that victims are not being able to reach nearby hospitals in time in such emergency situation. So to help them in this situation and make the process easy we made an app “Crash”. 
            <br>
            This app is been built so help can be provided to the needy in time. Design of app is simple and easy to understand that also a common man can report accidents .</p>

            <!--container for Challenges-->
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>There were two key goals that I had to accomplish for this project:</p>
            <p> 1. To identify factors contributing to incidents or accidents.
                <br>
                2. Design simple and user friendly interfaces that allow users to report the accidents quickly and easily.

            <!-- container for Style Guide header, images, and text -->
            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to experiment with using red and white theme for the UI as Red is generally the sign of danger or warning and on traffic lights, it signals potential hazard ahead and hence, so for the color palette, I opted for tones of Red and White. </p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Based on the project brief, I identified four tasks that potential users would accomplish when using the product. This was to ensure that I was emphasizing with users and basing my design decisions around them. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <p> 1. “I want to access the accident reporting section without having to register, so that I can report the accident and call for help as quickly as possible before having to create an account.”</p>
            <p> 2. “I want there to be a variety of accident options, so that I can choose the most related one that suits the incident the best.”<p>
            <p> 3. “I want to see time required for the help to arrive.”</p>
            <p> 4. “I want to be able to see when the help arrived, so that it can make me feel little relieved.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-container">
            <h3>User Flow</h3>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="case-container">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>After empathizing with users, I created the wireframes. I always keep my initial wireframes simple, in order to be able to quickly test them with users early in the process. Next, I digitalized my wireframes in
            Figma. </p>
            <br>

        <div class="case-container">
            <h2>User Testing</h2>
            <p>Using my professional network, I recruited 5 participants to accomplish a task scenario. I wanted to ensure that the flow and layout of my wireframes were intuitive and simple before moving on to finalizing my design. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Task Scenario:</h3>
            <p>You witnessed a road accident in which a bus and a scooter were involved. Report the accident and call for help.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>User Feedback:</h3>
            <p>A couple of pain points that I encountered were that the application requires good internet connectivity to feth the location automatically; they seemed uncertain about what if user does not have fast internet connectivity or has no internet connectivity. I ensured that these issues were all fixed right away for my next iteration. </p>
